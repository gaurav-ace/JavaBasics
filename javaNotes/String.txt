in java there are 3 ways to use strings : 

1) by using 'String' class
2) by using 'StringBuffer' class
3) by using 'StringBuilder' class

Difference between them : 
                                   String                                              StringBuffer                                     StringBuilder

 storage :                objects created are stored in                            stored in heap area                                 stored in heap area
                         Heap area / String Constant Pool         

 objects :                  objects are immutable                                        mutable                                            mutable
 
 
 thread safety :               not thread safe                                 methods are syncronised, so                              not thread safe
                                                                                        thread safe      
 
 equals() :             compares the content of two strings                   compares the refrence/ address                     compares the refrence/ address
                        and returns boolean, the method is                    of two strings, as parent class                    of two strings, as parent class
                            overriden in String class                              ( Object Class )                                       ( Object Class )

 
 concat() :                 new object is created,                               new object is not created,                        new object is not created,
                         older object is not affected                             same object is updated                            same object is updated
